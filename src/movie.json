      "Harvey Specter is the best closer in New York City. He's at the top of his game closing mergers, acquisitions and even divorces; it's in his blood. As a result of his success, Harvey is offered a promotion to senior partner at his firm, Pearson Harden. With that promotion, however, Harvey will need a little help. His boss, Jessica Pearson, has enlisted him in a hunt for a new associate.<br><br>Mike Ross isn't your average Harvard Law School student... he's not even enrolled there. But that doesn't stop him from taking the bar exam for Harvard graduates as a way to make money on the side. Mike is a prodigy; simply put, he's brilliant. He also has a photographic memory: if he reads something, he remembers it for life.<br>But Mike's grandmother is sick, and in order to help her, he needs to raise a lot of money. That's where his pot-dealing best friend comes into play. In a botched drug deal, Mike must escape drug-buying thugs. He serendipitously flees the scene and falls into a round of Harvey Specter's associate interviews. While Mike's in hiding, it doesn't take long for him to impress Harvey. And with that, the finest law duo in the toughest law town is born.<br>Mike gets situated at his new job at Pearson Harden, acquainting himself with those who will help him and those who will stand in his way. Harvey throws Mike his first case, a ''pro bono'' sexual harassment suit involving a CEO. But will Mike's need to raise twenty-five thousand dollars and his ''bad influence'' best friend get in his way? If Harvey is going to stay on top of his game, he'll have to keep Mike motivated and honest.",

      "The Originals is a spin-off from The Vampire Diaries which centers around the Mikaelson siblings, Klaus (Joseph Morgan), Elijah (Daniel Gillies), and Rebekah (Claire Holt). The backdoor pilot, which aired on April 25, 2013, also revealed that the werewolf Hayley (Phoebe Tonkin) is pregnant with Klaus's child and would, therefore, join the cast. The show begins with the original siblings returning to the city of New Orleans for the first time since 1919. Having originally built the city, they had been forced to flee from their vengeful father. In their absence, Klaus's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Marcel (Charles Michael Davis), took charge of the city. Klaus resolves that they must take down Marcel and get back the city that once belonged to them. While doing that they must also protect everything that they have built from the war brewing between the vampires, werewolves and the witches.",

    "description":
      "In Steven Universe, the world is protected from evil by the Crystal Gems, a group of intergalactic warriors who draw their power from special magical gem stones. The four Gems are Garnet, Amethyst, Pearl and Steven. Steven is a boy who inherited a gemstone from his mother, a Crystal Gem named Rose Quartz. As Steven tries to figure out the secrets of his gem, he spends his days in Beach City doing activities with the other Crystal Gems, his father or other humans, whether it's helping them save the universe or just hanging out.\r\n<br><br>\r\nThroughout the first season it is slowly revealed that the four Crystal Gems in Beach City are the remnants of a once great interplanetary civilization of Gems. Most of the locations visited by the Gems are ruined shrines or locations that were once of great importance to Gem culture, but have become derelict and fallen into disrepair during thousands of years of neglect. The second half of the season deals with this theme in greater depth, revealing that the Gems are cut off from their home world and that the monsters and artifacts they encounter throughout their adventures are actually Gems who have lost the ability to maintain rational humanoid forms. In the last few episodes of the season, it was also made clear that the plans of the \"Homeworld Gems\" for Earth and its inhabitants were not benign \u2014 and that after 5,000 years their attention is once again drawn towards Earth. This is expanded upon with the introduction of two new characters from the invading Gem home world: Jasper and Peridot. It is revealed that the Crystal Gems, led by Rose Quartz, rebelled against the machinations of the Gem home world and won, but remained on Earth as both its protectors and as exiles.",

      "The series revolves around social outcast Scott McCall, a high school student living in the town of Beacon Hills. Scott's life drastically changes when he is bitten by a werewolf, becoming one himself. He must henceforth learn to balance his problematic new identity with his day-to-day teenage life. The following characters are instrumental to his struggle: Stiles, his human best friend; Allison, his first love interest who comes from a family of werewolf hunters; Lydia, a banshee and Allison's best friend; and Derek, a mysterious werewolf with a dark past. Along the way, he encounters characters who shape him into a stronger werewolf and better person: Jackson, a bully from his high school; Malia, a were-coyote and Derek's cousin; Kira, a Japanese fox spirit and Scott's second love interest; and Liam, Scott's beta and the first human he bites. Throughout the series, he strives to keep his loved ones safe while maintaining normal relationships with them.",

      "People are not born equal, a realization that 4-year-old Midoriya Izuku faced when bullied by his classmates who had unique special powers. Izuku was one of the rare cases where he was born with absolutely no unique powers. This did not stop Izuku from pursuing his dream, a dream of becoming a great hero like the legendary All-Might. To become the great hero he hopelessly wants to become, he now will join the ranks of one of the highest rated \"Hero Academies\" in the country: Yueiko. With the help of his idol All-Might, will he be able to claim the ranks and become a true hero?",

      "iZombie is an American television series developed by Rob Thomas and Diane Ruggiero-Wright for The CW, and is a loose adaptation of the comic book series of the same name created by Chris Roberson and Michael Allred, and published by DC Comics under their Vertigo imprint. The series was officially picked up on May 8, 2014, for the 2014\u201315 season and premiered on March 17, 2015. The first season will consist of 13 episodes.\r\n<br><br>\r\nLiv Moore was a medical resident and an overall happy person. She had a happy loving family, a funny and cute fiance and she loved spending time with her friends. But her whole life went downhill at a party, at which she was turned into a zombie. Now she only hungers for brains. She quit her job at which she had a promising career, and started to work at the Seattle PD morgue, not only to satisfy her urge for brains, but to help the Police Department at solving crimes as a \"psychic\" consultant. With the help of her boss Dr. Ravi Chakrabarti, who is more fascinated by her condition than scared of it, and Detective Clive Babinaux, who believes that Liv is a psychic, she must help the people of Seattle, understand her condition, find out how she was turned into a zombie, and fight a menace on the rise.",

      "<b>Once Upon a Time</b> is Fairy Tale Land. It's filled with magic, monsters and all of the characters we all know from stories growing up. It's real, and so are the people in it. But unlike the \"happily ever after\" you may have heard about, their stories continued, and The Evil Queen cast a Dark Curse over the land...This is Storybrooke. It's a quiet, little New England town filled with people who go about their everyday lives with no idea who they really are. The Queen's Curse has trapped them here and placed her in near-complete control. They have no real memories and no real hope.",

      "Lincoln Burrows is currently on death row and scheduled to die in a few months for an assassination his younger brother Michael is convinced he did not commit. With no other options and time winding down, Michael takes drastic measures to get himself incarcerated alongside his brother in Fox River State Penitentiary. Once he's inside, Michael - a structural engineer with the blueprints for the prison - begins to execute an elaborate plan to break Lincoln out and prove him innocent. When Michael arrives at Fox River State Penitentiary, he meets the prison denizens who will, unknowingly, help in his escape plans - his cellmate, the lovelorn Sucre; beautiful prison doctor Dr. Sara Tancredi, who happens to be the governor's daughter; former mob boss John Abruzzi; and Warden Henry Pope. Meanwhile, outside the prison walls, the brothers' childhood friend and Lincoln's lost love, attorney Veronica Donovan, works within the law to free them; Lincoln's teenage son LJ may be going down a path similar to his convicted father's; and Secret Service Agent Paul Kellerman's investigation into Lincoln's case proves that there may be a national conspiracy.",

    "description":
      "The series revolves around Piper Chapman (Taylor Schilling), a woman living in New York City, who is sentenced to 15 months in a women's federal prison called Litchfield Penitentiary (operated by the \"Federal Department of Corrections\", a fictionalized version of the Federal Bureau of Prisons). She has been convicted of transporting a suitcase full of drug money to her former girlfriend Alex Vause (Laura Prepon), an international drug smuggler/mule. The offense had occurred ten years prior to the start of the series, and in that time Piper had moved on to a quiet, law-abiding life among New York's upper middle class, so her sudden and unexpected arrest seriously disrupts her relationships with her fianc\u00e9 and her family.<br><br>In prison, Piper is reunited with Alex (who might or might not have named Piper in her trial, resulting in her friend's arrest), and they re-examine their relationship and deal with their fellow prisoners. The show often shows flashbacks of significant events from the past of various inmates. These flashbacks may explain how the inmate came to be in prison or otherwise further develop the character's backstory.",

      "<b>Legion</b> introduces the story of David Haller: Since he was a teenager, David has struggled with mental illness. Diagnosed as schizophrenic, David has been in and out of psychiatric hospitals for years. But after a strange encounter with a fellow patient, he's confronted with the possibility that the voices he hears and the visions he sees might be real. He's based on the Marvel comics character Legion, the son of X-Men founder Charles Xavier (played by Patrick Stewart and James McAvoy in the films), first introduced in 1985.",

      "<b>Scorpion</b>, inspired by a true story, is a high-octane drama about eccentric genius Walter O'Brien and his team of brilliant misfits who comprise the last line of defense against complex, high-tech threats of the modern age. As Homeland Security's new think tank, O'Brien's \"Scorpion\" team includes Toby Curtis an expert behaviorist who can read anyone; Happy Quinn, a mechanical prodigy; and Sylvester Dodd, a statistics guru. Pooling their extensive technological knowledge to solve mind-boggling predicaments amazes federal agent Cabe Gallo, who shares a harrowing history with O'Brien. However, while this socially awkward group is comfortable with each other's humor and quirks, life outside their circle confounds them, so they rely on Paige Dineen, who has a young, gifted son, to translate the world for them. At last, these nerdy masterminds have found the perfect job: a place where they can apply their exceptional brainpower to solve the nation's crises, while also helping each other learn how to fit in.",

      "etter Call Saul is the prequel to the award-winning series Breaking Bad, set six years before Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk) became Walter White\u2019s lawyer. When we meet him, the man who will become Saul Goodman is known as Jimmy McGill, a small-time lawyer searching for his destiny, and, more immediately, hustling to make ends meet. Working alongside, and often against, Jimmy is \"fixer\" Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks), a beloved character introduced in Breaking Bad. The series will track Jimmy's transformation into Saul Goodman, the man who puts \"criminal\" in \"criminal lawyer.\"\r\n<br>\r\nThe series also stars Michael McKean as Chuck McGill, Rhea Seehorn as Kim Wexler, Patrick Fabian as Howard Hamlin, and Michael Mando as Nacho Varga -- characters that will represent both legitimate and illegitimate sides of the law.\r\n<br><br>\r\nBreaking Bad creator and showrunner Vince Gilligan and Breaking Bad writer and producer Peter Gould created the show together and serve as co-showrunners of the premiere season. Gilligan directed the first episode of the series, which has already been greenlit for a second season of 13 episodes. The debut season will consist of 10 episodes.",
